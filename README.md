# Graph-coloring-algorithms
C++ implementations of TABU search, Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm / Generic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Squaky Wheel Optimization for Graph Colorings used in bachelor thesis

Tabu search -- One exchange neigbourhood
HEA -- Greedy crossover and others mentioned in 1999 Galinier et al "HEA for Graph Coloring"
SA -- one exchange neighbourhood + edge function; penalty function from 1991 Johnson et al "Optimization by simulated annealing"; as well as new modified penalty function
SWO -- try to re-implement original algorithm of Joslin et al 1998 "SWO"
