# Graph-coloring-algorithms
C++ implementations of TABU search, Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm / Generic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Squaky Wheel Optimization for Graph Colorings used in bachelor thesis
Codes are modified or built on foundation of C++ implementations of R.M.R. Lewis  

Tabu search -- One exchange neigbourhood
HEA -- Greedy crossover and others mentioned in 1999 Galinier et al "HEA for Graph Coloring"
SA -- one exchange neighbourhood + edge function; penalty function from 1991 Johnson et al "Optimization by simulated annealing"; as well as new modified penalty function
SWO -- try to re-implement original algorithm of Joslin et al 1998 "SWO"

To launch project successfully, download whole folder with relevant code and create a "project from files" in Visual Studio. I am not sure how else it can be made to work.
